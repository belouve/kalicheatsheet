## Download, Install, and Credits

Go and [download the Kali Linux distro](http://www.kali.org/downloads/)

I highly recommend you [download the VMware image](https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-vmware-arm-image-download/) and download Virtual Player/VirtualBox. Remember that it will be a gz-compressed and tar archived file, so make sure to extract them first and load the vmx file.

A lot of info is derived from [The Hacker Playbook 2](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1512214566/). I have a signed copy, and I intend to get a non-signed copy to bang around and make notes in.

Installation and configuration for Kali Linux is not really "plug and play"...so here are a bunch of config notes.

For your VM, you may need some extra tools.

●	[Oracle VM VirtualBox Extension Pack](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

## Once Your Kali VM is Up and Running

```
●	Log in with the username root and the default password toor
●	Open a terminal
●	Change the password
	○	passwd
●	Update the image OR SUPERUPDATE
	○	apt-get update
	○	apt-get dist-upgrade
●	Superupdate
	○	Line to copy-paste if you want to drop it in a terminal:
	○	apt-get update && apt-get -y upgrade && apt-get -y dist-upgrade && apt-get -y autoremove && apt-get -y autoclean && searchsploit -u	
●	Setup Metasploit database
	○	service postgresql start (or, systemctl start postgresql)
●	Make postgresql database start on boot
	○	update-rc.d postgresql enable
●	Start and stop the Metasploit service (this will setup the database.yml file for you)
	○	Try this: msfdb init
		msfconsole
		msf > db_status	
●	Install gedit
	○	apt-get install gedit (Response of 'already latest version')
●	Configure gedit
	○	Preferences
	○	View: Display line numbers, Highlight current line
	○	Editor: Tab width 5, Insert spaces instead of tabs
	○	Color Scheme: Oblivion
●	After this I did a apt autoremove as cleanup
```


## Change the hostname
Many network admins look for systems named Kali in logs like DHCP. It is best to follow the naming standard used by the company you are testing.  This is still really essential in 2022 even, caught a pentester generating alerts and the hostname came up as "KALI".  If they blended with our environment would have tajken longer to identify and shut it down. Even a random LT5309 or SUPPORTLAPTOP would be great.

Also, use OSINT here too.  If you know close tech partners of target, name the PC something relevant.  Healthcare? Make it HIPAA23.  Or troll, if pentesting McDonalds make your box name HOMEOFTHEWHOPPER or something.
```
	○	gedit /etc/hostname
		■	Change the hostname (replace kali) and save
		■	I like to rename it loki, the trickster.  Or REDSHIRT, for a test box.  "REDSHIRT is down" is a great error message.
	○	gedit /etc/hosts
		■	Change the hostname (replace kali) and save
	○	reboot
```

### Optional for Metasploit - Enable Logging
○	I list this as optional since logs get pretty big, but you have the ability to log every command and result from Metasploit’s Command Line Interface (CLI). This becomes very useful for bulk attack/queries or if your client requires these logs. *If this is a fresh image, type msfconsole first and exit before configuring logging to create the .msf4 folder.
```	
●	From a command prompt, type:
	○	echo “spool /root/msf_console.log” > /root/.msf4/msfconsole.rc	
●	Logs will be stored at /root/msf_console.log
```
Now may be a good time to setup a new normal user to be able to use sudo, and not run everything as root

See here: https://github.com/belouve/kalicheatsheet/blob/master/setup.md#create-a-new-normal-user-with-sudo-permission-in-kali-linux

## Tool Installation

### Terminator
○	Allows multiple split windows of terminals, all within one tool.  No more opening multiple instances of terminal.  Run it, add to favorites, and never open regular terminal again, open this instead.
```
●	apt-get install terminator
●	Now, Close your terminal and open up terminator. Right-click context menu allows you to split and make a new terminal.
```


### Fish Shell
○	Should be one of the first things you install, and invoke this shell every time with the command 'fish'.  Sometimes you will have syntax issues, especially with any one-liners that have && .  In this case, invoke bash.
```
●	apt-get install fish
●	fish
●	Now, do most of the remaining steps from within fish shell.  If anything has an && , either break it up, or invoke bash.
```

### Lazy Script
○	The LAZY script will make your life easier, and of course faster. https://github.com/arismelachroinos/lscript/blob/master/README.md
```
●	cd
●	git clone https://github.com/arismelachroinos/lscript.git
●	cd lscript
●	chmod +x install.sh
●	./install.sh
●	Invoke with 'l'.  Yes, the first letter only, from the word lazy.  It's that lazy.
```

### Pentester Framework:
○	PTF attempts to install all of your penetration testing tools (latest and greatest), compile them, build them, and make it so that you can install/update your distribution on any machine. Everything is organized in a fashion that is cohesive to the Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES) and eliminates a lot of things that are hardly used. 
```
●	PTF: https://github.com/trustedsec/ptf
●	For a video tutorial on how to use PTF, check out our Vimeo page here: https://vimeo.com/137133837
●	git clone https://github.com/trustedsec/ptf
If you want to install and/or update everything, simply do the following:
	○	./ptf
	○	use modules/install_update_all
	○	yes
```

### Password Lists
●	For the different password lists, see the section: Special Teams - Cracking, Exploits, and Tricks

## Installing Firefox Add-ons
```
●	Web Developer Add-on: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/web-developer/
●	Tamper Data: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tamper-data/
●	Foxy Proxy: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/foxyproxy-standard/
●	User Agent Switcher: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/user-agent-switcher/
●	You can reboot your browser now
```

## Installing Chromium
○	Chromium is "an open-source browser project that aims to build a safer, faster, and more stable way for all users to experience the web." I (@ulicbelouve) am a fan of Firefox, but this is another option, with wmap (see below)
```
●	apt-get install chromium
●	Type 'y' and hit the return key when prompted for confirmation
```

### Configure Chromium / wmap
○	If Chromium is opened, it will close in the background without apparent error.  The following configuration will allow Chromium to function with wmap.  wmap is a mass web screenshot tool for mapping out large web networks. Feed it a list of URL(s) and/or Nmap scan data and it will generate you a screenshot report of those web services. Created to allow people to get a visual "map" of their web infrastructure.
```
●	​​Edit the following file: /etc/chromium.d/default-flags
●	Add the following entries to the default-flags file
	  export CHROMIUM_FLAGS="$CHROMIUM_FLAGS ​--no-sandbox"​
	  export CHROMIUM_FLAGS="$CHROMIUM_FLAGS -user-data-dir"​​​
	     This line is necessary in order for Chromium to work in Kali because Kali runs as root
	  export CHROMIUM_FLAGS="$CHROMIUM_FLAGS --ignore-certificate-er​rors"
	     This line is necessary to make wmap work as well as possible.  If wmap is not needed, then this line is 
	     not needed
●	Launch Chromium
●	A prompt may load explicitly stating that it is a bad idea to run chromium as root.  Ignore this
	  ​The known way around this issue would be to designate a user specifically for chromium usage
●	You can see my additions below, on how to "Create a new normal user with sudo permission in Kali Linux", then it should not balk at the oversight
●	​If Chromium does not start, validate that the entries in the default-flags file are correct
```

### Installing wmap
```
●	​Go to the webstore (url: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/)
●	Search for wmap
●	Click "ADD TO CHROME"
●	A pop up should appear asking for confirmation to Add "wmap".  Click "Add extension"
```


*Remember to check http://thehackerplaybook.com/updates/ for any updates.

It is also recommended to configure a Windows Virtual Machine.  This will be detailed in a separate "cheat sheet"

## Extras from Belouve:

### Create a new normal user with sudo permission in Kali Linux
```
●	Open a terminal and issue the following command:
	●	useradd -m belouve
	●	-m creates a home directory for the user (belouve in this example).
●	Now we have to set a password for the user.
	●	passwd belouve
	●	It will ask you to create a new password. 
●	At this point, we have a new user account. But we might want to add our new user to the “sudoers” group, so that we can use “sudo” to do administrative actions.
	●	usermod -a -G sudo belouve
	●	The option -a means to add and ‘-G sudo’ means to add the user to the sudo group. If you want to know more about the usermod command, issue  #man usermod command to know more about usermod
●	Now we have to specify the shell for our new user.
	●	chsh -s /bin/bash belouve
	●	chsh command is used to change the login shell for a user. 
●	All done.! you are all set. You could logout and login to your new account.
```

### HexChat
○	IRC Client
```
●	apt update && apt install -y hexchat
●	Then theme it by grabbing theme of https://dl.hexchat.net/themes/MatriY.hct
●	More themes at https://hexchat.github.io/themes.html
●	unzip ~/Downloads/MatriY.hct -d ~/.config/hexchat
●	/.config is a hidden folder in your Home directory /home/belouve
```

### SSHpass
○	SSHPass is a tiny utility, which allows you to provide the ssh password without using the prompt. This will very helpful for scripting. SSHPass is not good to use in multi-user environment. If you use SSHPass on your development machine, it don't do anything evil. I use this to get a quick login for my SSH tunnel
```
●	apt-get install sshpass
```
### iftop
○	You'll need this in order to make sure bandwidth monitoring works.
```
●	apt-get install iftop
```

### Searchsploit update
○	Periodically update SearchSploit, or add it to your update string (see SuperUpdate above)
```
●	searchsploit -u
```

### Setting proxies:
```
Acquire::http::proxy  "http://10.EXA.MPL.E0:3128/";
Acquire::ftp::proxy "http://10.EXA.MPL.E0:8080/";
Acquire::https::proxy "http://10.EXA.MPL.E0:8080/";
●	Hey guess what? You need to have the ; at the end of each line
●	3128 is HTTP proxy, 8080 is HTTP, 443 is HTTPS over SSL
```
